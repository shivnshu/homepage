            <div class="entry"><p>Windows, the most popular operating system, works well for the day-to-day activities but is of little help when it comes to programming and development.<br>
Inspired by seniors, I took my first step towards using Ubuntu, the most popular linux, as the host operating system about a year ago. It seemed very uncomfortable at first to use this not-so-good-looking OS. But overtime, the simplicity and easeness of use overweighted the weird looking UI. Various open-source tools and extensions helped me to get rid of so-seemed ugly look(<em>which I later discovered was the real beauty</em>).  </p>

<p>As my voyage of exploring computers continued, I fell in love with Ubuntu(<em>which really was the love for linux</em>). Motivated by my old-interest in Security, I tried installing some pentesting tools in it, but it failed badly as I was many a times left with many broken packages. Then I decided to use Kali Linux, the most popular linux for pentesters.  </p>

<p>Kali Linux installation became my first dirty and time consuming installation. At that time, it had some problems with its Grub bootloader installation when dual booted with Windows(<em>ah, I didn&#39;t mention, I had to always have Windows in one partition, Inventor Stuff</em> üôÅ) but, my not-leaving attitute motivated me to try again and again but I failed. Then I got a idea of Triple booting. I installed Ubuntu in a partition and Kali in another without any bootloader, went to Ubuntu and updated grub, thus got all three entries like charm.<br>
I used Kali as my host OS for the next 2 months, playing with its awesome set of tools. Then, I heard of LFS, Arch and Gentoo. At first, I was too afraid to try it on host system, so I used Virtual Box. But I was brave enough to try LFS on my host sytem, don&#39;t know why. Installing LFS increased my confidence and made me habitual of sitting in front of computer and just praying that nothing goes wrong.  </p>

<p>Finally, I decided to install Arch on my host system. I deleted every partition on my hard disk including EFI partition, and then made partitions one by one. After about 4 hours of following installation guide and dealing with problems, I was with my newly installed OS with awesome Desktop Environment(GNOME). Later, I had to install windows in another partition( <em>Again Office Stuff</em> ) and deal with the great Windows bootloader overwriting skills.</p>

<h4>Why Arch Linux?</h4>

<p>Why not <a href="https://www.gentoo.org/">Gentoo</a>? I have used Gentoo for some time, and was impressed by its documentation. The concept of compiling the package that you want to use and customising it using something called <a href="https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/USE_flag">USE flags</a>, seems to be very exciting. But, it consumes too much time( <em>my laptop is not that fast</em> ). It took me 5 hours just to install it. Taking in account the limitation of time and risk associated with compiling packages, I think Arch Linux is good enough for me to be used as my host OS at this time. In future, I hope, I will be using Gentoo and appreciating its beauty of concept.</p>
