title: Journey from Windows to Arch Linux
---
Windows, the most popular operating system, performs very well for the day-to-day usage but when it comes to the programming and development it becomes a pain.  
Inspired by seniors, I took my first step towards using Ubuntu, the most popular linux, as the host operating system about one year ago. At first, it seemed very uncomfortable to use this ugly looking OS(_compared to windows_). But as the time passed, the simplicity and easeness of use overweighted the weird looking UI. Various open-source tools and extensions helped me to get rid of so-seemed ugly look(_which I later discovered was the real beauty_).  

As my voyage of exploring computers continued, I fell in love with Ubuntu(_which was really the love for linux_). Motivated my old-interest in Security, I tried installing some pentesting tools in it, but it failed badly as I was many times left with many broken packages. Then I decided to use Kali Linux, the most popular linux for pentesters.  

Kali Linux installation became my first dirty and time consuming installation. At that time, it had some problems with its Grub bootloader installation when dual booted with Windows(_ah, I didn't mention, I had to always have Windows in one partition, Inventor Stuff_ üôÅ) but, my not-leaving attitute motivated me to try again and again but I failed. Then I got a idea of Triple booting. I installed Ubuntu in a partition and Kali in another without any bootloader, went to Ubuntu and updated grub, thus got all three entries like charm.
